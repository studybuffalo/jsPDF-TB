# jsPDF Toolbox (jsPDF-TB)
A repository to hold various tools to extend functionality of jsPDF, including table design and string measurement.

## Comments
These tools tend to be functionality I designed for other projects. At somepoint the intention will be to roll it all into a proper jsPDF plugin.
